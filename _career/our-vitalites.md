        <h4>Muntaj Begum, Senior Executive, Payroll and Claims</h4>
        <p>I am a payroll specialist in VITAL. Payroll work can be complex and demanding at times, but I am glad that I have strong support from colleagues who are like family.</p>
        <p>As a specialist with many years of payroll experience, I frequently conduct training to share my insights with younger colleagues who have just joined the team. This gives me great satisfaction and motivation!</p>
        <p>I am also grateful for the opportunities provided by VITAL. Over the years, I have received recognition for my contributions. These include the National Day Award for Efficiency, VITAL Services Ambassador Award and Long Service Award.</p>

        <p>I enjoy working with the people in VITAL, whom I have forged many friendships with. My colleagues are understanding and everyone works well together. VITAL is definitely a place I call home!</p>
        <p>In addition, the management here appreciates the hard work that staff have put in and offers us opportunities to develop our careers. I am glad for the opportunity to help out at the 4th ASEAN Finance Ministers’ and Central Bank Governors’ and Related Meetings and to lead several VITAL’s organisational initiatives.</p>
        <p>The challenging and dynamic work at VITAL gives me a great sense of satisfaction.</p>

        <p>Versatility is one word to describe my experience at VITAL. Through my 10 years at VITAL, I have handled diverse duties, due to the growing requirements of servicing numerous government agencies, and I learned so much. Even when faced with challenges, I was glad to have laughed off the stresses with the team and experienced very heart-warming moments throughout.</p>
        <p>There is no limitation to growth as bosses are supportive and team-mates cross-share knowledge, operating in a way that places collective goals ahead of individual glory.</p>
