Meet Amalina and Everlynn, two members of VITAL's HR Services team who have recently acquired low-code skills in RPA as part of the organization's workforce capability development program.

</p><p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">

Despite not having a technical background, they were able to learn and apply these skills to automate appointment formalities for new officers, resulting in a more efficient and streamlined process. Their journey was not without challenges, but their perseverance and dedication paid off, and they successfully built bots that have improved their work processes.

Their experience serves as an inspiration to other VITAL officers to take advantage of upskilling opportunities and leverage on technology to enhance work efficiency. #WorkforceTransformationSeries</p>
