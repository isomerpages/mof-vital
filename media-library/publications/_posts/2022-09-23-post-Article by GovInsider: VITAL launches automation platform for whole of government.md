The impact of front-facing government services is tangible and easily appreciated. Social grants uplift the vulnerable and the digitalisation and automation of critical services like transportation, taxation and construction make citizens’ lives better.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
But behind the scenes, thousands of moving parts need to work in sync to keep these public services running like a well-oiled machine. This is where central agencies like VITAL come in – they sit at the centre of Singapore’s government, supporting more than 100 public agencies and over 100,000 public officers in the area of corporate shared services, including human resources, finance and procurement.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
VITAL has taken their role to the next level with a plan to implement a new cloud-native automation platform. Based on software provider UiPath’s Automation Suite, this centralised platform will allow government agencies to easily access, collaborate and implement robotic process automation (RPA) solutions.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
“With VITAL’s robotics and automation efforts, public agencies will be able to increase work efficiency and free up officers from otherwise tedious and repetitive work. This will also enable them to continue delivering quality services while developing other value-added services,” says Leong Siew Keong, Chief Information Officer of VITAL.</p>
