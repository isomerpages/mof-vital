			<div style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">VITAL is unlike many other shared services organisations.  We do not merely process HR, finance and procurement transactions.  Rather, we see ourselves as an engine of innovation supported by a family of citizen developers.  Our unique approach has gained international attention – for example, in the Government Trends 2023 report published by Deloitte, VITAL’s approach towards leveraging technology to transform corporate services was used as a case study.</div><br>

		<td style="border: 0px;padding:0px;">
			<div style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">All this did not happen by chance.  Rather, it stems from our deep leadership belief that our people are our best asset.  Let me quote – “We must develop talents and skills of our people throughout their careers” (President Halimah Yacob – speech at the opening of the second session of 14th Parliament).  This is precisely what VITAL has been doing.  We have invested in significant resources to train all of you to be capable citizen developers and make use of low/no-code tools to help you streamline and automate work. Beyond this, it is also about preparing you and our workforce to stay relevant and skilled in a digital world. </div><br>

			<div style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">Many of you have stepped out of your comfort zone to attend the training, learn RPA skills and build your own bots.  193 of our VITALites are now trained in RPA, and more than 50 bots have been deployed, saving more than 15,000 hours of mundane work, freeing up time for you to focus your attention on other tasks.  Thank you for coming along on this exciting journey!</div><br>

			<div style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">Now, let me turn to the topic of career advancement – this takes the form of lateral and upward progression.  Lateral progression can be achieved through taking on more responsibilities, projects or assignments within a current role, or taking on new challenges through a different role. Upward progression typically involves advancing to roles of higher responsibilities, to achieve a broader and deeper impact on the organisation. </div><br>

		<td style="border: 0px;padding:0px;">
			<div style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">Regardless of the form, career advancement is anchored on competency-based growth, and not about clocking time or doing things well in a Business-As-Usual (or BAU) fashion. Neither is it about which school you attended or what grades you achieved in school. We celebrate the development of our many officers sitting among you today.  You have demonstrated such competency-based growth.</div><br>

Everlynn eventually managed to build a bot to automate the downloading and uploading of appointment formality documents, saving about 23 hours of tedious work per month for her team. This is all done without any technical, engineering or IT background. </div><br>
