VITAL has partnered Ngee Ann Polytechnic to equip VITAL officers with data analytic skills through training programmes such as the Specialist Diploma in Data Analytics (SDDA) and Certificate in Data Analytics (CDA).
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
As the closing project of the CDA course, 3 teams comprising 13 VITAL officers participated in a data hackathon on 1 and 2 August 2022. The teams unleashed their creativity and worked on actual business challenges faced by VITAL, from data analysis, visual analytics to dashboard charts and storytelling, which was good showcase of the data analytics skills and tools they learnt from the course.
