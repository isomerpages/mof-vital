VITAL was invited by the Civil Service College to conduct a sharing for public sector service leaders on leveraging RPA to improve work productivity on 6 April 2023.

<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
Ms Jessica Ong, Deputy Director (Innovation Hub) of VITAL, shared insights into the benefits and challenges of using RPA. She also deep-dived into common use cases where RPA can be applied to improve productivity in the service value chain.

While RPA is not a solution for every problem, it can be an effective enabler by removing mundane and repetitive tasks for staff to channel their precious time for higher value work.
