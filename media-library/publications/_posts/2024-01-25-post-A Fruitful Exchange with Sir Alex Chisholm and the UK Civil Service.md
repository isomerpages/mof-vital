<p>It was a great honour to welcome Sir Alex Chisholm, the Permanent Secretary
for the Cabinet Office, and Chief Operating Officer for the UK Civil Service,
along with the political team from the British High Commission Singapore,
to VITAL's office.</p>
<p>We took immense pride in sharing VITAL's remarkable transformation journey
and the impactful initiatives that have significantly contributed to enhancing
government efficiency and service quality. The exchange was incredibly
fruitful, and we are optimistic that the visit provided valuable insights
for Sir Alex Chisholm, as well as a deeper understanding of our efforts
to elevate service quality and ensure high-standard delivery for the Singapore
Public Service.</p>
