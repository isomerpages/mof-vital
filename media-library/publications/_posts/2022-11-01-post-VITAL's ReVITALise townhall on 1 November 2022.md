The theme of VITAL's ReVITALise townhall on 1 November 2022 was transformation and celebration. We looked back at how VITAL has redefined and transformed ourselves into Singapore Public Service’s central agency for corporate shared services and robotics & automation (R&A) lead for corporate and administrative services. At the same time, we also celebrated what we have achieved by recognising the great efforts and good work of VITAL staff.

During the session, VITAL shared about Singapore Government’s RPA story and roadmap, from VITAL’s role in leading the robotics shift, our citizen developer strategy, to creation of the bot library and the central RPA platform for whole-of-government.
</p>

VITAL’s online sharing was attended by government officials from more than 20 countries. It was also a great opportunity for us to learn and exchange ideas with foreign counterparts who are also involved in using RPA as a solution to improve work processes for the public sector.
