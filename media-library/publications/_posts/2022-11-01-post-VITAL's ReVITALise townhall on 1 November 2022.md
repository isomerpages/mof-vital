The theme of VITAL's ReVITALise townhall on 1 November 2022 was transformation and celebration. We looked back at how VITAL has redefined and transformed ourselves into Singapore Public Serviceâ€™s central agency for corporate shared services and robotics & automation (R&A) lead for corporate and administrative services. At the same time, we also celebrated what we have achieved by recognising the great efforts and good work of VITAL staff.

Congratulations again to all the recipients of the VITAL Go-the-Extra-Mile for Service Award and Internal Awards!
