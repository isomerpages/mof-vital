CE Dennis Lui took the stage at the Public Service Conference 2023, held at Singapore Expo, to share the inspiring success story of VITAL. This story is one of overcoming doubt, experiencing a light bulb moment, persevering through challenges, and pursuing a passion for excellence. </p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">	
	
At its core, VITAL is a story about building an army of Citizen Developers by identifying their capabilities and leveraging the power of Design Thinking, Data Analytics, and RPA. However, it is more than just a story about technology and innovation. It is a story about the people who made it happen. </p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
	
Through their hard work and dedication, the VITAL team has demonstrated that with the right mindset and tools, anything is possible. They have shown that by empowering Citizen Developers and fostering a culture of innovation and excellence, government agencies can achieve remarkable results. </p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
	
As we continue to strive for excellence in our work, we can draw inspiration from the VITAL story and the lessons it teaches about the power of collaboration, innovation, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. The VITAL success story is a testament to the Singapore government's commitment to leveraging technology and innovation to improve the lives of its citizens. </p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
	
We are proud to have been a part of this inspiring journey and to have served as an inspiration for all government officers to continue pushing the boundaries of what is possible and to strive for excellence in their work. </p>
