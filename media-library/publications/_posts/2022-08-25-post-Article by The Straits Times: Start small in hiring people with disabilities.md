Since 2016, VITAL has started to curate suitable job opportunities for persons with disabilities (PwDs). Today, we have 13 PwD colleagues with autism, hearing impairments or physical disability. They account for approximately 2.5% of our workforce. In addition, VITAL partners service providers and vendors who also have PwDs in their workforce.

VITAL was accredited with SG Enable's Enabling Mark (Gold) in 2021, which recognised our best practices and outcomes in disability-inclusive employment.
