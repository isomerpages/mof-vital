Here are the key highlights from her sharing:
<p align="justify">1. VITAL's data analytics pathway is a key strategy under the “People” pillar allowing VITAL officers to provide greater value-add to our stakhholders.<br>
• Data analytics skill is one of the key skills identified under the Shared Services Competency Framework.<br>
•	We train our officers to be citizen data analysts who are able to use data and conduct analysis regardless of their area of work.<br>
•	So far about 25% of our workforce are already trained.</p>

<p align="justify">2.	The Certificate in Data Analytics (CDA) and Specialist Diploma in Data Analytics (SDDA) programmes are specially structured to provide a better learning experience for the participants.
<br>•	Lessons are spaced out with breaks. Mid-point check-ins and additional guided practical lessons are arranged with officers. 
<br>•	The CDA is ended with a data hackathon targeting real business problems. Participants are empowered to use data to do analysis and influence key management decisions.</p>

<p align="justify">3.	Key take-aways in VITAL’s data analytics upskilling journey
<br>•	A clear data strategy is in place to govern the use of data and create opportunities for staff to apply what they have learnt.
<br>•	A community of practice is built where trained officers come together to share use cases and experiences.</p>
