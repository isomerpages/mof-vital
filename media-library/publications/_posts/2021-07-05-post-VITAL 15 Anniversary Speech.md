1.
Good morning VITALites Today, 5 th July 2021 marks
VITAL’s 15 th birthday!
VITAL’s
History
a.
Our Humble Challenging Beginning
2.
VITAL was officially launched on 5 July 2006 as CSS
Vital org We faced challenges from the outset The
transactional processing functions were moved using a ‘lift
and shift’ approach Streamlining of processes was difficult
to do
3.
Our pioneer batch of employees were from diverse
backgrounds, from different Ministries Creating a common
culture and identity was not an easy task
b.
Growth and Digitalisation
4.
But we prevailed We set up new service lines and
expanded our partner base to Statutory Boards Vital org
was rebranded as VITAL in 2011 This refresh gave us new
confidence to embrace change and sharpen our service
delivery
5.
We have championed digitalisation and automation For
example, VITAL was an early adopter of RPA technology
within the public sector
c.
VITAL’s Culture Transformation
6.
VITAL flourished with the strong commitment of our people
Some may remember the Family@Work movement, with
the 12 Tribes and CSR activities
Achievements
in FY 2020
7.
It was with a strong foundation, built upon the hard work and
sweat of VITALites both past and present, that we entered
the year 2020 And then COVID 19 hit us, a crisis of a
generation
8.
VITAL rose to the occasion We pivoted quickly to work from
home, Functions streamlined procedures in an agile
manner Together, we ensured no service disruptions
during Circuit Breaker
9.
We achieved 99 90 accuracy and timeliness in our
transactions processing in FY 2020 This is something I
dare not take for granted Thank you all for your hard work,
resilience and agility!
10.
But that is not all We challenged ourselves to emerge
stronger, and emerged we did!
a.
Emerging Stronger VITAL as Central Agency for
Corporate Shared Services
11.
VITAL is now the Central Agency for Corporate Shared
Services, with the mandate to transform corporate services
delivery
12.
In addition, we issued the Accountability Statement a
ground breaking document When agencies insource to
VITAL, we take on the accountability for ensuring that the
work is properly done, including answering to the auditors
Agencies now have the peace of mind when they partner
VITAL!
b.
Emerging Stronger Our People
13.
Our People have to emerge stronger so that VITAL can
emerge stronger We launched the Shared Services
Competency Framework and we are sending all officers
back to school, either for a Specialist Diploma in Data
Analytics or a Certificate in Data Analytics.

14.
We worked tirelessly on the upcoming roll out of the new
HRP system We onboarded more Statutory Boards onto
Shared Services under the new CUMULUS system and we
also did important rectification works for HRMS records
15.
We proactively supported Whole of Government’s COVID
19 efforts, for example by providing shared services support
for the SG United Traineeships
16.
Our Service Partner Satisfaction Survey achieved 81
overall satisfaction, a record high, in fact this is a whopping
95 if you include survey respondents who are least
somewhat satisfied This strong affirmation from our service
partners is testimony to all the good work that VITALites
have been doing
17.
We are inclusive 3 of our workforce are Persons with
Disabilities They contribute greatly to our successful
operations at VITAL and are part of our family I am glad
that inclusiveness was specially highlighted by Minister
Lawrence Wong, during his visit to VITAL on 28 June 2021.
a.
Key Initiatives for FY 2021
18.
There are 5 key initiatives we aim to implement in FY 2021
amongst others
19.
First, the VITAL DREAM project will redefine VITAL’s
Mission, Vision and Values, to be aligned with our new
mandate
20.
Second, as the Robotics and Automation Lead for
Corporate Services we will go upstream to streamline
processes and implement R&A solutions at scale across the
Whole of Government
21.
Third, we continue to work on HRP system
implementation and we will also onboard more Statutory
Boards onto Shared Services under CUMULUS.
22.
Fourth, we will upgrade iGEMS and VOICES so as to
improve our service delivery and improve work productivity
23.
Finally, we continue to transform the workforce by
focusing on the 3 ‘ namely Reskill, Resize and Reshape
Reskill We are training all of you in highly sought after
skills Resize We will streamline processes, deprioritise
areas of work which are no longer necessary, while
upskilling many of you into new roles and growth areas
Reshape We will reshape our jobs as well as the way we
are organised in view of VITAL’s growing responsibilities
Workforce transformation is a key strategy to attract and
retain talents like all of you VITALites for us to achieve our
next bound
b.
Measures to support and enhance staff well being
24.
On staff support and well being, you can look forward to a
redesign of our office workspaces This will better
support hybrid working arrangements and provide more
conducive spaces for collaboration.
25.
We will deploy vending machines that dispense healthy
snacks and beverages on a pilot basis We will adopt a
hybrid work arrangement To support you, we will enhance
the telecommuting subsidies
26.
COVID 19 will become endemic We need to refresh our
approaches towards work practices Please show empathy
and appreciate one another, even as collectively we work
hard and sometimes long hours to get the job done Let us
make hybrid work arrangements a successful reality for
VITAL
Emerging
Stronger
27.
Let me conclude with 3 points
28.
First let us relish the opportunity to do more as Central
Agency for Corporate Shared Services
29.
We are essential and we are important That is why
Minister Wong strongly encouraged VITAL to continue to
excel and improve in whatever we do By doing our work
well, and giving our agency partners the peace of mind,
they can then focus all their efforts to serve Singapore and
Singaporeans in their respective missions
30.
Second let us learn the lessons from COVID 19 and lock
in the gains
31.
Most importantly, it is the agile mindset that we must
embrace in this volatile and uncertain world
32.
Third VITAL will grow our people
33.
You have my commitment that VITAL will grow our people
and prepare ourselves for the future I ask you to come
along with VITAL, as we embark on this exciting journey
34.
The journey ahead will not be easy, but together, we can
achieve our dreams and aspirations, to become the Central
Agency for Corporate Shared Services that all of us will be
proud of
35.
Happy 15 th birthday VITAL!
