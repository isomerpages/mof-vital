<div style="font-size: 20px;">
Good morning VITALites. Today, 5th July 2021, marks VITAL's 15th birthday!
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 24px;color:blue;">
<b>VITAL’s History</b>
</div>
<div style="font-size: 22px;">
<b>a. Our Humble Challenging Beginning</b>
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
VITAL was officially launched on 5 July 2006 as CSS-Vital org. We faced challenges from the outset. The transactional processing functions were moved using a ‘lift and shift’ approach Streamlining of processes was difficult to do.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
Our pioneer batch of employees were from diverse
backgrounds, from different Ministries. Creating a common culture and identity was not an easy task.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 22px;">
<b>b. Growth and Digitalisation</b>
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
But we prevailed. We set up new service lines and expanded our partner base to Statutory Boards. Vital.org was rebranded as VITAL in 2011 This refresh gave us new confidence to embrace change and sharpen our service delivery.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
We have championed digitalisation and automation. For example, VITAL was an early adopter of RPA technology within the public sector.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 22px;">
<b>c. VITAL’s Culture Transformation</b>
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
VITAL flourished with the strong commitment of our people. Some may remember the Family@Work movement, with the 12 Tribes and CSR activities.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 24px;color:blue;">
<b>Achievements in FY2020</b>
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
It was with a strong foundation, built upon the hard work and sweat of VITALites both past and present, that we entered the year 2020. And then COVID 19 hit us, a crisis of a generation.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
VITAL rose to the occasion. We pivoted quickly to work from home. Functions streamlined procedures in an agile manner. Together, we ensured no service disruptions during Circuit Breaker.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
	We achieved 99.90% accuracy and timeliness in <b>our transactions processing in FY 2020.</b> This is something I dare not take for granted. Thank you all for your hard work, resilience and agility!
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
But that is not all. We challenged ourselves to emerge stronger, and emerged we did!
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 22px;">
<b>a. Emerging Stronger - VITAL as Central Agency for Corporate Shared Services</b>
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
VITAL is now the Central Agency for Corporate Shared Services, with the mandate to transform corporate services delivery.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
	In addition, we issued the <b>Accountability Statement</b> - a
ground-breaking document. When agencies insource to VITAL, we take on the accountability for ensuring that the work is properly done, including answering to the auditors. Agencies now have the peace of mind when they partner VITAL!</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 22px;">
<b>b. Emerging Stronger Our People</b>
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
Our People have to emerge stronger so that VITAL can emerge stronger. We launched the <b>Shared Services Competency Framework</b> and we are sending all officers back to school, either for a Specialist Diploma in Data
Analytics or a Certificate in Data Analytics.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
We worked tirelessly on the upcoming roll-out of the new HRP system. We onboarded more Statutory Boards onto Shared Services under the new CUMULUS system and we also did important rectification works for HRMS records.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
We proactively supported Whole-of-Government’s COVID-19 efforts, for example by providing shared services support for the SG United Traineeships.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
Our <b>Service Partner Satisfaction Survey</b> achieved 81% overall satisfaction, a record high, in fact this is a whopping 95%, if you include survey respondents who are least somewhat satisfied. This strong affirmation from our service partners is testimony to all the good work that VITALites have been doing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
We are inclusive - 3% of our workforce are Persons with Disabilities They contribute greatly to our successful operations at VITAL and are part of our family. I am glad that inclusiveness was specially highlighted by Minister
Lawrence Wong, during his visit to VITAL on 28 June 2021.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 24px;color:blue;">
<b>Looking Forward to FY21 and Beyond</b>
</div>
<div style="font-size: 22px;">
<b>a. Key Initiatives for FY2021</b>
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
There are 5 key initiatives we aim to implement in FY 2021, amongst others.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
First, the <b>VITAL DREAM project</b> will redefine VITAL’s Mission, Vision and Values, to be aligned with our new mandate.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
Second, as the <b>Robotics and Automation Lead for Corporate Services,</b> we will go upstream to streamline processes and implement R&A solutions at scale across the Whole of Government.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
Third, we continue to work on <b>HRP system implementation</b> and we will also onboard more Statutory Boards onto Shared Services under CUMULUS.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
Fourth, we will upgrade <b>iGEMS and VOICES</b> so as to improve our service delivery and improve work productivity.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
Finally, we continue to <b>transform the workforce</b> by focusing on the 3 'Rs' namely Reskill, Resize and Reshape. <b>Reskill:</b> We are training all of you in highly sought-after skills. <b>Resize:</b> We will streamline processes, deprioritise areas of work which are no longer necessary, while upskilling many of you into new roles and growth areas. <b>Reshape:</b> We will reshape our jobs as well as the way we
are organised in view of VITAL’s growing responsibilities. Workforce transformation is a key strategy to attract and retain talents like all of you VITALites, for us to achieve our next bound.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 22px;">
<b>b. Measures to support and enhance staff well-being</b>
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
On staff support and well-being, you can look forward to a <b>redesign of our office workspaces.</b> This will better support hybrid working arrangements and provide more conducive spaces for collaboration.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
	We will deploy <b>vending machines that dispense healthy snacks and beverages,</b> on a pilot basis. We will adopt a hybrid work arrangement. To support you, we will enhance the <b>telecommuting subsidies</b>.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
COVID-19 will become endemic. We need to refresh our approaches towards work practices. Please show empathy and appreciate one another, even as collectively we work hard and sometimes long hours to get the job done. Let us make hybrid work arrangements a successful reality for
VITAL.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 24px;color:blue;">
<b>Emerging Stronger</b>
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
Let me conclude with 3 points.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 22px;">
<b>First,</b> let us relish the opportunity to do more as Central
Agency for Corporate Shared Services. 
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
We are essential and we are important. That is why Minister Wong strongly encouraged VITAL to continue to excel and improve in whatever we do. By doing our work well, and giving our agency partners the peace of mind,
they can then focus all their efforts to serve Singapore and Singaporeans in their respective missions.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 22px;">
<b>Second,</b> let us learn the lessons from COVID-19 and lock
in the gains.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
Most importantly, it is the agile mindset that we must embrace in this volatile and uncertain world.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 22px;">
<b>Third,</b> VITAL will grow our people.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
You have my commitment that VITAL will grow our people and prepare ourselves for the future. I ask you to come along with VITAL, as we embark on this exciting journey.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
The journey ahead will not be easy, but together, we can achieve our dreams and aspirations, to become the Central Agency for Corporate Shared Services that all of us will be proud of.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>	
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
	<strong>Happy 15th birthday VITAL!</strong>
