Ms Kavitha Subash, Director (Central Services) of VITAL, has received the Enabling Champion Award presented by Minister Masagos Zulkifli at SG Enableâ€™s Enabling Mark Awards ceremony on 5 May 2023.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
The Enabling Champion Award seeks to recognise management staff who have championed inclusive hiring and implemented measures to enable the organisation to successfully integrate employees with disabilities.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">With eight autistic officers and 32 SPD clients in her team, Kavitha spearheaded initiatives to empower and upskill them to bring out their best potential. She put in lots of time and efforts in engaging the persons-with-disabilities (PwD) officers, understanding their needs and aspirations, and curating development opportunities for them.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
Under her leadership, the PwD officers were empowered to take on higher value work and progress on their career pathways. In addition, Kavitha encouraged and supported them to upskill through data analytics, RPA and design thinking courses, and curated suitable projects to allow these officers to put their new skillsets into practice.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">We would like to congratulate Kavitha on her meaningful award and express our sincere gratitude to her for her commendable efforts in integrating PwD employees and creating value-add to our organisation!</p>
