<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">With eight autistic officers and 36 persons-with-disabilities (PwDs) clients from SPD in her team, Kavitha played an integral role in empowering and upskilling them to bring out their best potential. She put in lots of time and efforts in engaging the PwD officers, understanding their needs and aspirations, and curating development opportunities for them.</p>
