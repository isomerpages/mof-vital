VITAL has received the Workforce Transformation Award presented by Mr&nbsp;Leo Yip, Head of Civil Service, at the Public Service Transformation Award ceremony on 5 July 2023.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
The award is a testament to VITAL’s sustained efforts in upskilling our workforce to adapt to the expanded business roles and technology advancements, thanks to our three-pronged approach: citizen developer strategy, progressive upskilling and reskilling of staff, and new career opportunities for officers in digitalisation, automation and ops-tech.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
VITAL’s Shared Services Competency Framework was introduced in 2021 to move our staff beyond transactional processing to become shared services professionals who are able to provide insights from data, recommend policy and process improvements, and create more value-add to service partners. In line with this, data analytics, design thinking and RPA citizen developer were identified as critical skills. Today, 23% of our workforce are trained in data analytics, 35% trained in design thinking and 27% trained in RPA automation.
</p>

As for career progression, greater focus is now placed on collecting experiences and deepening skills and competencies, as the Singapore Public Service shifts towards “lifelong employability”. For this purpose, our officers are now provided with more upskilling and reskilling options such as training, short-term immersion programmes, job rotations and work attachments.
</p>

As shared by Mr Dennis Lui, Chief Executive of VITAL, in the Government Trends 2023 report by Deloitte Insights, “The application of robotics and automation is not just about enabling VITAL to provide public service agencies with more effective and efficient services; the core of our purpose is to equip and empower our people by giving them the tools and opportunities to move up the value chain.”

As we celebrate receiving of the Workforce Transformation Award, we would like to take the opportunity to thank all our colleagues, partners and friends for partnering us in this journey. We look forward to your continued support as we work hard to bring VITAL to greater heights!
