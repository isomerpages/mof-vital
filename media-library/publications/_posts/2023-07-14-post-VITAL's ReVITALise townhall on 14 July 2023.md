VITAL's ReVITALise townhall was held on 14 July 2023.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
The latest generative AI technology offers tremendous opportunities to solve problems in new ways and find better ways to work. However, the biggest challenge is not the technology itself, but the mindset shifts required for us to get out of our comfort zone and embrace the changes. While VITAL provides the modern tools, support and safety net for staff to innovate, our officers must also embrace the opportunities to upskill, apply new technologies and explore process redesign.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
In this spirit, we were heartened to see many VITAL staff who have taken the first steps to innovate and showcased their new ways of working at the townhall, including the winners of the RPA Gamification Challenge, a colleague demonstrating examples of instant photo editing powered by AI and a project team tapping data analytics to generate insights for our snacks vending machine. Even the winner of the VITAL Values Mascot Design Contest, which was voted by participants at the townhall, was created by AI! These are the best examples of the theme of our townhall - "Unleashing possibilities".
</p>

Last but not least, a big thank you to our colleagues who have worked hard on this event and congratulations again to all the award winners!
