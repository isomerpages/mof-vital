	The mission of <a href="https://www.uipath.com/solutions/industry/public-sector-automation">public sector services</a> is often defined as serving the people, by the people. With the help of software robots, humans are empowered to achieve greater productivity and satisfaction at work, which benefits the employee, the organization, and the citizen. This is where <a href="https://www.uipath.com/rpa/robotic-process-automation">robotic process automation</a> (RPA) can shine.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
At a webinar jointly organized by UiPath and the Singapore government’s shared services department VITAL on Dec 9, 2021, experts shared insights that highlighted the need for public agencies to automate processes. Not only does automation improve public service delivery, but also enhances experiences for both employees and the public.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
	As automation permeates the public sector, it frees up time for employees to improve the quality of the citizen experience.
</p><br>
<div style="font-size: 20px;color:#49759a;text-align:justify;">
	"Moving forward, the human-to-human interaction is still important, and that's intangible. Leveraging automation would enable public agencies to engage citizens in a positive way, which is a huge win."

The need for faster uptake
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
	Today, despite the acceleration of remote work, public agencies worldwide are still lagging when implementing automation.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
	According to <a href="https://spectrumsmartcities.com/smarter-central/smart-government-digital-transformation.html">research firm Gartner</a>*, "more than 60% of governments will have tripled their digital services by 2023, but fewer than 25% will be integrated across organizations’ silos."
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
	There is a "huge opportunity" to address these issues now, said David Burrows, Public Sector Industries Leader at UiPath.
</p><br>
<div style="font-size: 20px;color:#49759a;text-align:justify;">
	"Most [agencies] have been focused on low-hanging fruit until now. Many large legacy systems in government are falling apart at the seams in terms of maintenance. Legacy systems are also expensive to replace, but RPA can help extend the life of legacy systems and get more value out of them."

Automation is a key enabler towards <a href="https://www.uipath.com/blog/digital-transformation">digital transformation</a>. By leveraging automation, public sector employees can increase their bandwidth for more meaningful efforts, Burrows added. For example, employee efforts that strengthen trust between the people and the government.

Automation strengthens organizational resilience
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
	<a href="https://www.uipath.com/resources/covid-automations">During the pandemic</a>, public agencies around the world have scrambled to cope with citizen requests like the influx of calls at contact centers. This has led to frustrated citizens and low morale among employees.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
	"By freeing workers' time and maximising their job satisfaction, businesses can gain a competitive edge with the aid of emerging technology, which is now a business imperative," he continued.

Ultimately, automation can maximise workers’ productivity and empower them to focus on higher-value work such as innovation."</p>
