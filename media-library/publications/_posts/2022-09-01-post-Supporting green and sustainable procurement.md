<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
VITAL actively supports Singapore Government's green and sustainable procurement by introducing sustainability requirements in our demand aggregation (DA) contracts.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
For example, BCA Green Mark certified rating is required for event venues listed in the DA contract. In terms of electronics and electrical appliances, there are also requirements for PUB's Water Efficiency Label and NEA’s Energy Label.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
Through such requirements, VITAL shapes government agencies' buying behaviour, influences suppliers towards green and sustainable practices, and contributes to the reduction of environmental impact.
