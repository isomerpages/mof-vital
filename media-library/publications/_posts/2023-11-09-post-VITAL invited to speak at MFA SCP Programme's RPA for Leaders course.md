VITAL was invited to speak about our journey in digitalising administrative services within the Singapore Public Service at the Singapore Cooperation Programme’s "Robotic Process Automation (RPA) for Leaders” course, which saw the attendance of public officials from around the globe. &nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">

The programme was aligned with VITAL's efforts in leading the government's RPA initiatives and transforming digitally-enabled shared services through RPA. VITAL's Director (Service Partnership &amp; Innovation) Alex Tang delivered an insightful presentation on the importance of developing staff capabilities across the Public Service for proficiencies in RPA and new technological tools. We are proud to have had the opportunity to share our expertise and contribute to the ongoing digital transformation of the public sector.&nbsp; </p>
