	UiPath’s Office Worker Survey 2022 of over 500 workers in Singapore revealed that 66% of them are feeling increased pressure at work due to labour shortage. 77% of respondents in Singapore feel that automation could help their organisation attract new and retain existing talent.

"By freeing workers’ time and maximising their job satisfaction, businesses can gain a competitive edge with the aid of emerging technology, which is now a business imperative,” said Richard Harshman, senior vice-president and managing director of Asia Pacific at UiPath.

Dennis Lui, Chief Executive of VITAL concurs adding: "Not only does automation allow employees to save time, but it also ensures that workers are not bogged down by mundane tasks which lead to burn-out. Ultimately, automation can maximise workers’ productivity and empower them to focus on higher-value work such as innovation."
