	Here are the key highlights from Mr Lui’s speech!

Empowering people with technologies
</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
A shift in mental model is required to be more resilient to changes. In order to grow and empower our staff, VITAL will use and leverage latest technologies, especially those on Cloud, to unleash the productivity of our people.

Role of shared services
</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
The role of shared services as transactional services has changed over the years. Shared services is now an engine of transformation in the organisation, resulting from the centralisation of HR and finance processes, and the data and new technologies that came with them. VITAL will look for inspiration from other industries and benchmark with the private sector.

Leadership in public sector
</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
In this uncertain and complex world, leaders should lead with humility, with a focus on the people. Leaders need to set strategy for the organisation, and stay with the team to bring out the best in the people, in order to unleash their ambition and productivity.
