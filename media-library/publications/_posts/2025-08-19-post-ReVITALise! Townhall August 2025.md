<p>On 19 August, VITAL came together as One VITAL for our bi-annual ReVITALise!
Townhall – a day filled with reflection, recognition and renewed energy
for the journey ahead.
<br>
<br>From a hearty buffet lunch and gallery walk of FY24 achievements to award
presentations, Q&amp;A with senior management, and fun staff activities,
the event strengthened bonds and celebrated our collective journey.
<br>
<br>The townhall was more than just an update; it was a reminder that transformation
at VITAL is powered by our people. Thank you to all staff who joined us
in celebrating how far we’ve come, and in shaping the road ahead together.
<br>
<br>Here’s to continuing our mission to transform and deliver corporate shared
services for the Singapore Public Service!</p>
