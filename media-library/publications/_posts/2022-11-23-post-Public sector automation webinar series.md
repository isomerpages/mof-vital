VITAL has partnered with SimplifyNext and UiPath to organise a series of webinar, to share how automation can be a force for good if its adoption benefits organisations, employees, and the broader society and environment. The series aim to provide insights into how agencies can enable digital upskilling opportunities, business agility and improve citizen experience through automation in the public sector.

The first session of the webinar series was successfully held on 23 November 2022. Speakers from VITAL, SimplifyNext, UiPath and Civil Service College shared their insights into democratising digital transformation through citizen development strategy across the public sector and a sneak peak of new capabilities for citizen developers to leverage on in future. Close to 200 public officers from about 50 agencies attended the session.
