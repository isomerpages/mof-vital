At VITAL, we believe in an inclusive environment where every employee is able to give their best and contribute to growth of the organisation, regardless of their age, gender, physical, medical or other conditions.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
Today, VITAL has hired persons-with-disabilities (PwDs) to perform various shared services roles. These colleagues account for approximately 2.5% of VITAL’s workforce.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
Last year, VITAL had been accredited with SG Enable’s Enabling Mark (Gold), which recognised VITAL for our best practices and outcomes in disability-inclusive employment.
