It was VITAL's great honour to receive the Recognition Award of HR Powerbank Early Adopter from Madam Halimah Yacob, President of Singapore, at Human Capital Singapore - SG Enable Masterclass at The Istana on Thursday, 3 November 2022.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
VITAL was mentioned in Madam President’s speech as one of the early adopters of the Human Capital Singapore HR Powerbank. As an extension of our inclusive hiring efforts, VITAL has partnered HR Powerbank to employ more persons with disabilities for jobs in the HR domain.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
Mr Dennis Lui, Chief Executive of VITAL, also participated in a panel discussion hosted by Mr Tan Chuan-Jin, Speaker of The Parliament, on the topic of “Pivoting Evidence-Based Outcomes - Integrate. Involve. Innovate.”
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
We are humbled by this recognition award, a testament to our practices in supporting disability-inclusive hiring. We look forward to working with like-minded organisations on this meaningful journey.
