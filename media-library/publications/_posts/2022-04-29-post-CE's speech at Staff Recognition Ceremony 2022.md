				While I would have liked to hold this ceremony in person, the safe management measures had yet to be relaxed at the point of planning. Hence, out of prudence, we are doing a virtual ceremony again this year so that all our
Promotees, Award recipients, your families and more VITALites can join us in
			this joyous occasion.

				In 2021, VITAL became the Central Agency for Corporate Shared Services and our role is now to transform corporate services delivery for the Whole-of-
Government. We all need to adopt a lifelong learning mentality especially in this
uncertain and fast-changing environment. Today, I would like to share with you
inspiring lifelong learning journeys from 3 of our Long Service Award recipients.

				First, Mdm Muntaj Begum. Muntaj started her career as an Office Attendant in 1981. She moved to the Salaries Section in MOE and joined VITAL in 2006 as
a Payroll and Claims Senior Officer. Throughout her career, Muntaj invested
time and effort to build up payroll expertise through on-the-job training, studying
IM guidelines and payroll concepts, seeking advice from more experienced
colleagues as well as learning how to operate with new payroll systems. It was
very challenging, but she persevered!

		</td>
		<td style="border: 0px;padding:0px;">
			<div style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
				Today, Muntaj is one of the pillars in the HPA payroll team. She shares her
deep knowledge selflessly as a mentor to new staff. She conducts payroll
training sessions and developed the payroll OJT programme. In 2009, she was
appointed as part of the Quality Assurance team to review MFA payroll. She
attained a Foundation Certification in Accounting from ISCA in 2019. In
recognition of her contributions, Muntaj was awarded the Efficiency Medal in
the 2016 National Day awards. What an inspirational story! Muntaj receives
her 40-years long service award this year!

				Second, Ms Fariadah Omar from HPE. Fariadah started her career as a
Clerical Officer handling payroll with MOE in 1991 and subsequently took on a
supervisor role due to her good work performance. She joined VITAL in 2006
as a Payroll and Claims Officer. In 2013, Fariadah upgraded herself and
obtained the Career Readiness Certificate at the supervisory level. In 2016, Fariadah was rotated to a Human Resource portfolio. She mastered the HR
processes within a short period of time. Looking for better ways to do her work,
Fariadah explored the use of Macros to process contract renewal cases during
the COVID-19 Circuit Breaker period.

her wealth of experience, it is not surprising that she is an adviser to many;
often advising her colleagues and MOE partners on HR and Payroll processes.
She receives her 30-years Long Service Award this year.
