VITAL has received the “Recognition of Excellence Award” conferred by OpenGov Asia, recognising our efforts in robotic process automation (RPA). As Singapore Public Service’s robotics & automation lead for corporate and administrative services, VITAL has been actively pursuing digitalisation and adoption of RPA to transform the delivery of corporate shared services.

We are humbled by this recognition, a testament to the drive and agility of all VITAL staff, and are inspired to push on with our citizen developer and automation journey!
