Our second and third batches of 24 VITAL staff graduated with the Specialist Diploma in Data Analytics (SDDA) by Ngee Ann Polytechnic on 2 May 2023!
</p>


<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
They have completed the 5-month SDDA course which is one of the milestone training programmes under VITALâ€™s Shared Services Competency Framework to prepare VITAL staff with the knowledge, skills and abilities required for the evolving roles in corporate shared services.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
We look forward to seeing the SDDA graduates apply what they have learnt to tackle real business challenges at work and champion data analytics projects at VITAL!
