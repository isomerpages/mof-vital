23 VITAL officers successfully completed Ngee Ann Polytechnic's Certificate in Data Analytics (CDA) in November 2022.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
As the closing project of the CDA course, the participants were divided into four teams to compete in a data hackathon on 29 November 2022, to work on actual business challenges faced by VITAL and come up with innovative solutions.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
A team made up of officers from different functions was given the opportunity to work on a topic related to credit management's debt recovery. Although none of them was from credit management function, the team was still able to analyse the datasets and provide recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the debt recovery framework. Well done!
</p>

Congratulations again to all the participants for completing the CDA successfully!
