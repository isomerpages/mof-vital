			<div style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">(Slide 1) The topic of my presentation is “Modernising your Shared Services Digital Infrastructure to Support Hybrid Models and Agile Operations”. This is not going to be a technical talk for CIOs, but more on how VITAL is pushing ourselves to develop digital capabilities, to remain relevant, in the world of endemic COVID.</div><br>

			<div style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">(Slide 3) First, just who or what is VITAL? I dare say that VITAL is one of most important government agencies in Singapore that most people have not heard of. We serve over 100,000 public servants across more than 100 Singapore Government agencies, in Human Resources & Payroll, Finance and Procurement. VITAL is about 500 strong and growing. But now, we are excited to leverage our centre of Government position, assume the role of a Central Agency for Corporate Shared Services as well as the Robotics & Automation (R&A) lead for our domain.</div><br>

			<div style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">(Slide 4) VITAL was established in 2006 as a shared services centre for 18 agencies. We had a very difficult task of amalgamating many unique processes across agencies. We were seen like a vendor. But we are not a vendor, we are a Department under the Ministry of Finance.</div><br>

She moved to the Salaries Section in MOE and joined VITAL in 2006 as a Payroll and Claims Senior Officer. Throughout her career, Muntaj invested time and effort to build up payroll expertise through on-the-job training, studying IM guidelines and payroll concepts, seeking advice from more experienced colleagues as well as learning how to operate with new payroll systems. It was very challenging, but she persevered!</div><br>

She attained a Foundation certification in Accounting from ISCA in 2019. In recognition of her contributions, Muntaj was awarded the Efficiency Medal in the 2016 National Day awards.

In 2016, Fariadah was rotated to a Human Resource portfolio. She mastered the HR processes within a short period of time.

At the public service level, PSD introduced Our Core Competencies (or OCC) which articulate the critical behaviours expected of all public officers. We incorporated the OCCs in the Appraisal & Development Plan (ADP) to facilitate developmental conversations between you and your supervisors last year. Going forward, OCCs will also be used for performance, promotion readiness and leadership potential assessment. We will share more details later this year.</div><br>
