Introduction
</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
1. (Slide 1) Ladies and Gentlemen, good morning. My name is Dennis, Chief Executive of VITAL, Ministry of Finance. A warm welcome to all our international delegates! It is good to see so many Shared Services leaders in person. I hope you get some time to enjoy Singapore!</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
2. (Slide 1) The topic of my presentation is “Modernising your Shared Services Digital Infrastructure to Support Hybrid Models and Agile Operations”. This is not going to be a technical talk for CIOs, but more on how VITAL is pushing ourselves to develop digital capabilities, to remain relevant, in the world of endemic COVID.</p>
