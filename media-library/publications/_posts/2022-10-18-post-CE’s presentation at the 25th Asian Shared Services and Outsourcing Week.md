Introduction
</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
1. (Slide 1) Ladies and Gentlemen, good morning. My name is Dennis, Chief Executive of VITAL, Ministry of Finance. A warm welcome to all our international delegates! It is good to see so many Shared Services leaders in person. I hope you get some time to enjoy Singapore!</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
2. (Slide 1) The topic of my presentation is “Modernising your Shared Services Digital Infrastructure to Support Hybrid Models and Agile Operations”. This is not going to be a technical talk for CIOs, but more on how VITAL is pushing ourselves to develop digital capabilities, to remain relevant, in the world of endemic COVID.</p>

3. (Slide 2) To do that, I would need to set the context of VITAL and how we have evolved and transformed in the past 3 years.</p>

4. (Slide 3) First, just who or what is VITAL? I dare say that VITAL is one of most important government agencies in Singapore that most people have not heard of. We serve over 100,000 public servants across more than 100 Singapore Government agencies, in Human Resources & Payroll, Finance and Procurement. VITAL is about 500 strong and growing. But now, we are excited to leverage our centre of Government position, assume the role of a Central Agency for Corporate Shared Services as well as the Robotics & Automation (R&A) lead for our domain.
