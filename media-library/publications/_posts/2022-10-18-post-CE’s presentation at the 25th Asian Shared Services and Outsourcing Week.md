Introduction
</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
1. (Slide 1) Ladies and Gentlemen, good morning. My name is Dennis, Chief Executive of VITAL, Ministry of Finance. A warm welcome to all our international delegates! It is good to see so many Shared Services leaders in person. I hope you get some time to enjoy Singapore!</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
2. (Slide 1) The topic of my presentation is “Modernising your Shared Services Digital Infrastructure to Support Hybrid Models and Agile Operations”. This is not going to be a technical talk for CIOs, but more on how VITAL is pushing ourselves to develop digital capabilities, to remain relevant, in the world of endemic COVID.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
3. (Slide 2) To do that, I would need to set the context of VITAL and how we have evolved and transformed in the past 3 years.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
4. (Slide 3) First, just who or what is VITAL? I dare say that VITAL is one of most important government agencies in Singapore that most people have not heard of. We serve over 100,000 public servants across more than 100 Singapore Government agencies, in Human Resources & Payroll, Finance and Procurement. VITAL is about 500 strong and growing. But now, we are excited to leverage our centre of Government position, assume the role of a Central Agency for Corporate Shared Services as well as the Robotics & Automation (R&A) lead for our domain.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
5. (Slide 4) VITAL was established in 2006 as a shared services centre for 18 agencies. We had a very difficult task of amalgamating many unique processes across agencies. We were seen like a vendor. But we are not a vendor, we are a Department under the Ministry of Finance.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
6. (Slide 5) So, we pushed ahead. We increased the standardisation of corporate processes, to improve efficiency. We digitalised corporate processes and harnessed the power of automation for productivity gains.	</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
7. (Slide 6) In 2020, VITAL was appointed Central Agency, with the mandate to transform corporate services delivery, as well as R&A lead to explore and scale up the adoption of suitable R&A corporate services solutions for Whole-of-Government (WoG).</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
8. (Slide 7) Then the pandemic hit our shores. Thankfully, VITAL pivoted with great agility to Work-from-Home.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
9. (Slide 8) VITAL kept the lights on and ensured that our public sector colleagues continued receiving their salaries, allowances and claim reimbursements.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
10. (Slide 8) There were minimal disruptions to VITAL’s operations. We hit 99.90% accuracy and timeliness in our processing; and 95% satisfaction in our Service Partner Satisfaction Survey 2020, our highest ever. A very strong affirmation for VITAL from our service partners. Since then, VITAL never looked back.	</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
11. (Slide 9) Being a central agency, VITAL was no longer just a transactional backroom. VITAL had to do some heavy lifting.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
12. (Slide 9) This began with VITAL playing an integral role in the development and implementation of two Whole-of-Government corporate systems, one for the Ministries and the other for Statutory Boards.	</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
13. (Slide 9) With our familiarity with ops processes, VITAL worked closely with policy & system owners (policy) as well as IT vendors (tech) as part of a policy-ops-tech nexus, to develop and implement these 2 major systems.</p>
	
<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
14. (Slide 10) Amidst the crisis, there are always opportunities. There was an unprecedented level of cooperation from our stakeholders to embrace digitalisation and explore innovation.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
15. (Slide 10) VITAL stepped forward to help fellow public sector agencies design and implement innovative corporate solutions, amidst the challenging backdrop of COVID-19.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
16. (Slide 10) For example, on recruitment, we transformed our Appointment Formalities service from a face-to-face to a fully digital end-to-end process for about 50 agencies, fulfilling over 6,000 appointments between 2020-2021. On retirement, physical briefings were replaced with teleconferencing for pensioners, and wet-inked signatures with e-signatures for pension papers. Digitalisation has reduced processing time by 3 times, benefiting staff and retiring officers.</p>2
	
<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
17. (Slide 11) We looked beyond the immediate challenges of the COVID-19 crisis to pilot new technologies with agencies. For example, we organised and led the pilot of a low code/no code Robotics and Process Automation (RPA) software with twelve (12) agencies. This successful pilot helped make the case that these new low code technologies could be easily used across different parts of the Singapore Government, and not just VITAL. We piloted cloud-based recruitment technology with seven (7), and this demonstrated the potential of using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in the traditional recruitment space.</p>
