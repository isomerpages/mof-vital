Under the citizen developer strategy, VITAL started to roll out RPA training to our staff in 2021. Since then, more than 150 VITAL officers have attended the RPA training, learning to perform task automation using low-code/no-code tools. This accounts for more than a quarter of our total staff strength. Our target is to train all our staff without IT/tech background as citizen developers.

To encourage the course participants to apply what they have learnt to work and to boost their confidence in building their own automation bots, hands-on clinic sessions were also held to provide opportunities for staff to develop RPA use cases with the guidance of the trainers. In addition, an RPA hackathon will be organised in the coming months for our staff to tackle real business use cases. We look forward to seeing our staff unleash their creativity and come up with their automation bots in the upcoming VITAL RPA hackathon.
