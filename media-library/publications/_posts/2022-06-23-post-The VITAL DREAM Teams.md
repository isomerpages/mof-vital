The VITAL DREAM Teams were formed in 2021 to refresh VITAL’s mission, vision and values (MVV), in view of VITAL’s new mandates as Singapore Public Service's central agency for corporate shared services, and robotics and automation (R&A) lead for corporate and admin services.

In the June 2022 issue of VITAL MOMENTS, members of the DREAM Teams share about their journey of re-defining VITAL's MVV and their key take-aways.
