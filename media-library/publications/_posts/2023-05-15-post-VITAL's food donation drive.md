VITAL has partnered non-profit organisation Food from the Heart to conduct a food donation drive to support underprivileged families in Singapore. Thanks to the generous contribution in kind by VITAL staff, we were able to collect and pack 60 food hampers (worth $3,000) for low-income households.

We would like to express our deepest appreciation and gratitude for the contributions in kind by 64 donors,  and the efforts of 35 volunteers involved in packing and delivering the food hampers to Food from the Heart. VITAL teamâ€™s collective work has made a positive impact on the 60 low-income households receiving these food hampers.
