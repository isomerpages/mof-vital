20 citizen developers from VITAL joined students from Institute of Technical Education in a 1-day bot building workshop at the Bot Lab of ITE College East. The workshop provided hands-on training to our staff, allowing them to develop RPA bots tapping on a low-code platform.

A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. We are glad to see our staff embarking on their RPA journey with their first attempts.

We would also like to extend our sincere thanks to Automation Anywhere and PwC Singapore for hosting this workshop for VITAL.
