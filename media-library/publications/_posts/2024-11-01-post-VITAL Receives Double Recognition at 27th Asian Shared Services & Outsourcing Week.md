<p>VITAL is proud to have participated in the 27th Annual Asian Shared Services
&amp; Outsourcing Week, a globally recognised, annual industry awards ceremony,
which honours and celebrates SSC and service delivery teams who have exceeded
industry standards in their SS&amp;O initiative.</p>
<p>Represented by Mr. Sai Kuan Yuen, our Deputy Chief Executive, we are thrilled
to have received honorary mentions for two SSON Impact Awards – Automation
Impact Award and Diversity &amp; Inclusion Impact Award.</p>
<p>The Automation Impact Award recognises our advancements in Robotic Process
Automation (RPA) and our efforts to cultivate a digital-first culture.
Our RPA initiatives and centralised RPA platform have boosted internal
efficiency and established new standards for public sector automation.</p>
<p>The Diversity &amp; Inclusion Impact Award acknowledges our commitment
to fostering an inclusive workplace. This recognition reflects our ongoing
efforts to build a workforce which recognises diverse talents.</p>
<p>Let’s continue to inspire and innovate in shared service delivery, automation,
and workplace inclusivity as we strive for excellence in the Singapore
Public Service!</p>
