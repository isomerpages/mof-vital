<p>For years, a government agency called Vital had been humming in the background,
paying out the salaries&nbsp;and expense claims of more than 100,000 public
servants in Singapore.</p>
<p>No one paid it much attention, as its 500 workers chugged along, cutting,
pasting, reconciling spreadsheets. Much of their work was laborious, tedious,
and honestly, could have been done by machines.</p>
<p>Four years ago, something happened. The agency got a new chief, a new
dream, and for its 500 workers - a new aspiration to become citizen developers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this episode of Work Talk, ST senior correspondent Krist Boo takes
you into Vital to meet Mr Dennis Lui, its chief executive and hear how
employees are automating their own work processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>2:26</em></strong><em> Vital’s existential crisis; finding the right partner to customise its courses for retraining</em>
</p>
<p><strong><em>5:18</em></strong><em> Validation boost: In 2020, the government gives it the mandate to transform corporate services delivery</em>
</p>
<p><strong><em>6:28</em></strong><em> The elephant in the room: Addressing fears of automation, advice for employers in similar situations</em>
</p>
<p><strong><em>8:59</em></strong><em> Join us at a work station in Vital’s office to hear about a citizen developer’s work&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p><strong><em>10:38</em></strong><em> Bonus segment: How will your dragon year be?</em>
</p>
