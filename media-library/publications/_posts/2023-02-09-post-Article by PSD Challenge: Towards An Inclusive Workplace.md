Welcoming people with disabilities at work goes beyond physical accommodations. Central agency VITAL and the National Library Board (NLB), which has hired people with disabilities since 1991, show how aspects such as job scope and training support can create inclusive workplaces.</p>

At the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library in the National Library Building on Victoria Street, Library Service Assistant Dorothy Tang can often be seen walking through the various floors of the reference section to shelve and check that books are in their right places.Dorothy is one of about 30 persons with special needs who works at the National Library Board (NLB).
After having tried jobs such as data entry and warehouse stocking, Dorothy, who is on the autism spectrum, took up her current role at the NLB in January 2020.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">“Working in a library really suits me,” she said. “The work taps on my strength of being able to pay strong attention to detail, especially when I shelve books and do shelf-reading.”</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">A long-time partner of the Autism Resource Centre (ARC), the NLB signed a Memorandum of Understanding in 2015 to set up a digital services centre at the Enabling Village.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">This provided employment for 15 people on the autism spectrum to do digitisation work, such as scanning print materals and post-processing work (e.g., cropping material), before doing final quality assurance checks.
Besides the digitisation work, others in the team on the autism spectrum like Dorothy help to sort, shelve and arrange the library materials at Lee Kong Chian Reference Library.

Boosting Training, Support and Resources
</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">To support persons with disabilities (PwDs) in taking on roles in the NLB, its staff split the PwDs’ tasks into simple steps and specific instructions, and provided step-by-step training and documentation to equip them with the necessary skill sets.  
Over time, some NLB staff have also gone the extra mile to help their colleagues.
