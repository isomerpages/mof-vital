Welcoming people with disabilities at work goes beyond physical accommodations. Central agency VITAL and the National Library Board (NLB), which has hired people with disabilities since 1991, show how aspects such as job scope and training support can create inclusive workplaces.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
At the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library in the National Library Building on Victoria Street, Library Service Assistant Dorothy Tang can often be seen walking through the various floors of the reference section to shelve and check that books are in their right places.Dorothy is one of about 30 persons with special needs who works at the National Library Board (NLB).
After having tried jobs such as data entry and warehouse stocking, Dorothy, who is on the autism spectrum, took up her current role at the NLB in January 2020.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">“Working in a library really suits me,” she said. “The work taps on my strength of being able to pay strong attention to detail, especially when I shelve books and do shelf-reading.”</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">A long-time partner of the Autism Resource Centre (ARC), the NLB signed a Memorandum of Understanding in 2015 to set up a digital services centre at the Enabling Village.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">This provided employment for 15 people on the autism spectrum to do digitisation work, such as scanning print materals and post-processing work (e.g., cropping material), before doing final quality assurance checks.
Besides the digitisation work, others in the team on the autism spectrum like Dorothy help to sort, shelve and arrange the library materials at Lee Kong Chian Reference Library.</p>

Boosting Training, Support and Resources</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
To support persons with disabilities (PwDs) in taking on roles in the NLB, its staff split the PwDs’ tasks into simple steps and specific instructions, and provided step-by-step training and documentation to equip them with the necessary skill sets.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">Over time, some NLB staff have also gone the extra mile to help their colleagues.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">For example, in NLB’s Resource Discovery and Management Division, a team member would sit next to a deaf colleague during meetings and write down the discussion points so that the latter could follow and participate. Other members would also look directly at this colleague when speaking, so that she can lip-read.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">The entire team even took up a sign language course so that they would be able to communicate better with their colleague.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">One team member, Mr Mohammed Shafie Haja Mohaideen, Associate Librarian, Resource Discovery and Management Division, “The [sign language] course [also] gave us insight into how challenging non-verbal communication can be, and how to understand and be understood.”</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text align:justify;">This helped them better understand how their deaf colleague deals with the challenges at work, as they continue to find ways to make the workplace an inclusive one</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text align:justify;">To recognise NLB’s efforts in creating an inclusive workplace, SG Enable, the agency for enabling PwDs, conferred the NLB with the Enabling Mark (Gold) award for two years from 2021 to 2023.</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px;color:#a91932;text-align:justify;"> Supporting PwDs’ Career Growth</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text align:justify;">In 2021, VITAL, the Public Service’s central agency for corporate shared services, was also awarded the Enabling Mark (Gold) by SG Enable.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text align:justify;">PwDs employed by the agency have the opportunity to hone both their hard and soft skills.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text align:justify;">Mr Chew Jian Xiong, an Executive in the Digitalisation Services department, is one such staff member. He is part of a team digitalising files for 38 public agencies.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text align:justify;">After joining VITAL, Jian Xiong, who has autism, went through a two-part training with support from an assigned ARC Job Coach. “I learnt both hard skills based on my department’s requirements and soft skills such as work habits and workplace communications,” he said.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text align:justify;">He also took up a four-week Robotic Process Automation online course recommended by VITAL and run by business automation service UiPath.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text align:justify;">This allowed him to develop software skills and improve productivity by building virtual bots to reduce manual work. He has worked with colleagues to automate the manual search of records with a bot, which will save about 600 man-hours a year.</p>
