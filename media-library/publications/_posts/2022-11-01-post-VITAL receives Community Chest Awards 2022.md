VITAL has received 2021 Share Gold award at the Community Chest Awards 2022. We are humbled to be recognised for our efforts in building a caring and inclusive society.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
We look forward to making further strides on this meaningful journey with like-minded organisations across people, private and public sectors.

VITALâ€™s online sharing was attended by government officials from more than 20 countries. It was also a great opportunity for us to learn and exchange ideas with foreign counterparts who are also involved in using RPA as a solution to improve work processes for the public sector.
