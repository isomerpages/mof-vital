Jointly organised by VITAL, UiPath and SimplifyNext, the 2nd session of the public sector webinar series on automation was held successfully on 30 March 2023.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
This session looked into how agencies in the public sector can effectively scale automation while ensuring compliance with regulations and maximising its potential benefits.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
Besides VITAL’s sharing of our RPA governance and operating model, we were also pleased to have guest speakers from fellow agencies - Mr Patrick Poh (Director, Research &amp; Technology, LTA) and Mr Abdul Samad Gulam Hussain (Senior Deputy Director, Business Incubator &amp; Accelerator, CPF Board) - to share how their agencies scaled up RPA initiatives, the challenges they overcame, and how they established a robust governance framework to manage risks.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
More than 350 public officers from around 70 agencies attended the session and benefited from the informative and candid sharing of our expert speakers.
</p>
