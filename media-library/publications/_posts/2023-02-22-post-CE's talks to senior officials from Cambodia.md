<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">As part of the Temasek Foundation - Civil Service College Public Administration (Digital Government) in Cambodia programme, Mr Dennis Lui, Chief Executive of VITAL, was invited to give two talks to senior officials from Cambodia, to share about VITAL's digitalisation and transformation journey.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">The Cambodian delegation was led by H.E Youk Bunna, Secretary of State, Ministry of Civil Service.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">It was a great opportunity for us to learn and exchange ideas with foreign counterparts who are also looking at using digital tools to enhance and transform the public service.</p>
