Jointly organised by VITAL, UiPath and SimplifyNext, the third session of the public sector webinar series on automation was held successfully on 19 July 2023. This session explored how artificial intelligence (AI) solutions could be combined with RPA to deliver more complex process automation involving document inputs and unstructured data.

Besides the sharing by VITAL, UiPath and SimplifyNext, we were also pleased to have guest speaker, Mr Danny Lim, Principal Manager, Strategic Planning and Transformation Department, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), share how MOM is moving towards intelligent automation. A student team from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) also inspired us with their winning use case from NTUâ€™s recent RPA hackathon.
