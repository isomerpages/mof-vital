<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
We are proud to have our first batch of 15 VITAL staff graduating from the Specialist Diploma in Data Analytics (SDDA) by Ngee Ann Polytechnic! Well done!
</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
Congratulations also to our new colleague Vincen (2nd pic) who had earlier taken the SDDA programme on his own accord!
</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
They have completed the 5-month SDDA course with modules such as data visualisation, descriptive statistics and programme for analytics. The SDDA is one of the programmes under VITALâ€™s Shared Services Competency Framework launched in January 2021 to prepare VITAL staff with the knowledge, skills and abilities required for the evolving roles in corporate shared services, in view of the rising digitalisation and automation trend.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
With the full array of technical skills and tools, the SDDA graduates are now ready to champion data analytics projects at VITAL!
