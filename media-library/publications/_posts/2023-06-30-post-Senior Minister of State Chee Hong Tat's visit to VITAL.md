During his visit to VITAL on 30 June 2023, Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat was briefed on our automation strategy and interacted with our citizen developers and ops-tech specialists.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
We shared with SMS Chee that under VITAL's shared services competency framework and citizen developer strategy, our staff have actively embraced the opportunities for upskilling and training and are now busy with applying what they have learnt to automate and make process improvements to their work. By doing so, we are empowering our people and giving them a sense of ownership in their work, which creates a win-win both for the organisation and for the officers.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
We will continue to work hard and strive to become the catalyst and change agent for the entire public sector.
