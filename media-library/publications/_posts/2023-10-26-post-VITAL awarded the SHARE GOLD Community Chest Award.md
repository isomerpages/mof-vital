VITAL has been awarded the SHARE GOLD Community Chest Award (CCA) for our exceptional contributions to the social service sector. The CCA recognises organisations and individuals who have made a significant impact in caring for the less fortunate in our community. The event was held at The Istana and attended by the President of the Republic of Singapore, and hosted by the Minister for Social and Family Development. We are humbled and grateful for this recognition and the opportunity to contribute to the social sector!
