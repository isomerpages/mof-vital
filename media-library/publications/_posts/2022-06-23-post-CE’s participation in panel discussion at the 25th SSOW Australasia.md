	VITAL’s role as an ops-tech integration platform
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
	To reframe VITAL’s role as an ops-tech integration platform, we will try to promulgate and scale up investments in technologies such as RPA, as a service to the Whole of Government. Since VITAL is a provider of shared services to all government departments, such an approach will enable us to add value and become an engine of growth.

<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
	Office workers are motivated to seek a new position due to increased pressure on work/life balance (40%), lack of employee recognition (28%), and spending too much time on administrative tasks (27%).
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
	<b>Expanding roles are compounded by monotonous tasks</b>: 97% of respondents in Singapore say they feel exhausted at the end of a workday at least one day per week. They are frustrated by mundane tasks at work, like responding to emails (41%), scheduling calls and meetings (33%), and inputting data/creating datasets (33%).

What will stave off further resignations
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
	<b>Office workers believe automation is core to improving their job performance and satisfaction</b>: About 61% of office workers in Singapore feel like much of their workday is eaten up by tasks that can be automated. In addition, 52% believe that automation can improve their job performance, namely by saving time (62%), increasing productivity (57%), and creating opportunities to focus on more important work (50%). 76% agree they can focus on more creative work with the help of automation.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
	<b>Automation can help fight the Great Resignation</b>: 77% of respondents in Singapore contend that incorporating automation—including training on automation—could help their organisation attract new and retain existing talent, which is the second-highest of all countries polled.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
	"Office workers in Singapore are feeling burnt out and are seeking meaningful work, work/life balance and recognition. Businesses must innovate and transform with a long-term view as the war of talent continues to intensify in the country’s tightening labour market," said Rick Harshman, senior vice-president and managing director of Asia Pacific at UiPath.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
	Data from the Ministry of Manpower suggests that unemployment is heading back to pre-pandemic levels, from the steep 3.0% in 2020, down to 2.7% in 2021 and expectations to drop further in 2022.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
	Harshman suggests that businesses adopt technologies like automation to help to reduce mundane work and increase productivity, to ensure that they can retain and attract workers.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
	"By freeing workers' time and maximising their job satisfaction, businesses can gain a competitive edge with the aid of emerging technology, which is now a business imperative," he continued.
