<p style="font-size: 20px;color:#585858;text-align:justify;">
At VITAL's first in-person ReVITALise (VITALâ€™s townhall) since COVID-19, we launched our refreshed mission, vision and values. We aspire to be a globally recognised leader for corporate shared services. Our mission is to transform and deliver corporate shared services for the Singapore Public Service. And our core values are visionary, innovation, teamwork, agility and leadership.
