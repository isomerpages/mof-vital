<b>Through automation, VITAL empowers citizen developers within the Singapore government.</b>

</p>

Government agencies being understaffed with tight budgets isn’t new. VITAL, set up by the Singaporean Ministry of Finance in 2006, combines common corporate services in areas such as human resources, finance and procurement within the public sector to achieve scale, improve efficiency, strengthen governance and enhance service quality. </p>

With a crop of about 500 employees serving more than 100,000 government workers and over 100 agencies, the department has embraced automation to revolutionize its operations and equip its non-tech workforce as citizen developers. </p>

“We need to figure out how to empower and equip our people,” said Dennis Lui (pictured, right), chief executive of VITAL — the central agency for corporate shared services in the Singapore Public Service. “In Singapore, we face labor constraints and labor shortages. My bosses, to their credit, are happy to invest in technology. But even if I wanted to hire another 500 or 1000 people, I just cannot find them. I have to look for solutions, technological solutions that allow us to put our people at the center and augment their capabilities even better.” </p>

Lui and Muhammad Khidhir (left), senior section manager at VITAL, spoke with theCUBE industry analysts Lisa Martin and Rebecca Knight at the UiPath FORWARD event, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed VITAL embracing automation and cultivating a culture of innovation to achieve significant productivity gains.</p>
