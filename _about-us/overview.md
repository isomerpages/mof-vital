VITAL is the Singapore Public Service’s central agency for corporate shared services entrusted with managing and transforming corporate service delivery for Whole-of-Government. Established as a department under the Ministry of Finance in 2006, VITAL aggregates common corporate services in areas such as human resources (HR) & payroll, finance and procurement within the public sector to achieve economies of scale, improve efficiency, strengthen governance and enhance service quality. As a policy-ops-tech innovation platform and robotics & automation (R&A) lead for corporate and administrative services, VITAL also partners the functional leaders, as well as policy and system owners (namely, the Public Service Division, Accountant-General’s Department and Government Procurement Function Office) to transform Public Service corporate services. 

With more than 500 staff and still growing, VITAL is serving more than 100 public agencies (i.e.  ministries, organs of state, or statutory boards) and over 100,000 public officers.
